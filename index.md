The SecureFlag Community Edition is an open source training platform created for developers to learn and practice modern secure coding techniques through hands-on exercises. The platform helps develop secure coding skills through real-world challenges to ensure knowledge acquired during the course can be confidently and continuously applied in the real world.

Developers manually find, exploit and remediate the code of vulnerable applications running in disposable development environments accessed via a web browser. The platform offers 100% hands-on training, with no multiple-choice questions involved and uses an engine able to live-test code changes to measure efficacy, instantly displaying whether the code has been fixed and awarding points upon exercise completion.
